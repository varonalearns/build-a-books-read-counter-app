# Build a Passenger Counter App

## Summary
This is my solution to Build a Passenger Counter App lesson from The Frontend Developer Career Path that can be found on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). I personalized it to count the number of books I have read rather than count passengers.

## What I Learned

While working on this project, I learned the following:
- script tag
- variables
- numbers
- strings
- console.log()
- functions
- The DOM
- getElementById()
- innerText
- textContent

## Continued Development
I think in the future, I would like to expand this counter to be a little more robust. I can probably expand the interactivity. That is something to think about in the future.
